# Run_in_stand_Production_Software
This is a repository for software used in the Run_in_stands program. This program was written in Python and is used by a raspberry pi in the run in stand modified by D. Klimowicz. The program uses ethernet to communicate with the tester's PLC and our SQL server. This program uses python3.7 and has the following non-native imports and their revisions.

pylogix-1.0.6,
PyMySQL-1.1.1,
Datetime-5.5

Whenever any production software is updated on GitHub, this program needs to make its way to production. Currently, production is not familiar with GitHub but hopefully that will change with time.
