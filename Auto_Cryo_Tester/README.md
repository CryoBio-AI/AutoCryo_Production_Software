# AutoCryo_Production_Software
This is a repository for software used in the AutoCryo_tester program. This program was written in Python and is used by a raspberry pi in the Automated Cryocooler Tester made by W. Logan. The program uses MQTT to communicate with the tester's PLC and our SQL server. This program uses python3.7 and has the following non-native imports and their revisions.

paho_mqtt-2.1.0,
PyMySQL-1.1.1,
Datetime-5.5

Whenever any production software is updated on GitHub, this program needs to make its way to production. Currently, production is not familiar with GitHub but hopefully that will change with time.
