# BG_Production_Software
This is a repository for software used in production. These programs were written in Python and are used by a raspberry pi in the various pieces of production equipment for Fusion.

Whenever any production software is updated on GitHub, this program needs to make its way to production. Currently, production is not familiar with GitHub but hopefully that will change with time.
